I am a Ph.D. candidate and the University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine. I am in the Genomics and Computational Biology ([GCB](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/)) Graduate Program and Department of Biology. My advisor is [Prof. Junhyong Kim](https://kim.bio.upenn.edu/) at the Department of Biology. 

I am interested in understanding gene regulation using single cell multi-omics data, and decoding kidney development with multi-omics assays. For the past four years, I have been working on a specific -omics data, the snATAC-seq data. I have developed a tool to quantify snATAC-seq data uniformly for different technologies and estimate insertion rate (see [PIC publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.20.488960v1.full)). In addition, I have developed a tool to conduct differential accessible region test in snATAC-seq data (see [PACS publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.30.551108v1)). Collaborating with Prof. Katalin Susztak, I have also characterized the first kidney single cell open chromatin atlas for the developing and adult mouse (see [dev_kidney_atlas publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22266-1)).
